module Outpost
  # Scouts are responsible for gathering data about a something specific that is
  # a part of your system. For example, a HTTP Scout is responsible for getting
  # the response code (200 for OK, 404 for Page Not Found, etc.), response
  # body and any other thing you might want to know.
  #
  #
  # Scouts must also contain expectations. They must be registered into the
  # Scout that wish to support different types of expectations. You can supply
  # a block or an object that respond to #call and return true if any of the
  # rules match. It will receive an instance of the scout (so you can query
  # current system state) as the first parameter and the state defined by the
  # Outpost as the second.
  #
  #
  # Example:
  #   expect(:response_code) do |scout, code|
  #     scout.response_code == code
  #   end
  #
  # @example an example of a Scout that parses the HTTP response code
  #   module Outpost
  #     module Scouts
  #       class Http < Outpost::Scout
  #         expect(:response_code) { |scout,code| scout.response_code == code }
